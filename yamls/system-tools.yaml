  summary: Provides the tools a general Linux user expects on the command line
  description: >
            As the modular server is attempting to start from an extrememly
            small baseline, many of the tools one normally expects are not 
            provided by default. However, an evaluator of the modular OS often
            needs these tools. At present, there is nowhere to get them from, 
            hence the need for this module.
